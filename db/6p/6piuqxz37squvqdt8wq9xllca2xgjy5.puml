| * 9734e9fb Refactored the whole approach of layout configuration, cleaned up a lot of stuff. - Configuration via extension point or via preference page is not supported anymore. The layout view is still supported and is fed by implementations of ILayoutConfigurationStore. For programmatic configuration the new class LayoutConfigurator can be used, which can be put into DiagramLayoutEngine.Setup for invoking one of the layout methods of DiagramLayoutEngine. - The meta data classes on layout algorithms and options as well as the extension point schema have been moved to the service plugin. - Renamed KimlUtil to ElkUtil (resp. ElkServiceUtil, ElkUiUtil).
