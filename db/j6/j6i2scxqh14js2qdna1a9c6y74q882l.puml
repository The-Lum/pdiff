targets of structural

 nested in the source element

end note
' might we be able to state something like... F 0-nest-> TP to mean the same as F 0-left-> TP but have it place TP inside F?
' then, if I want to choose to switch from "F *-left-> TP" to "F 0-nest-> TP" is would be much easier.
' similarly there would be a "xx *-nest- xx", "xx o-nest- xx", "xx ..left..|> xx", for the other structural relationships..
' that would all nest the target in the source element.
