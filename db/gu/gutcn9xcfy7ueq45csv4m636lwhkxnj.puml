' interface's title is marked italic - that's fine

' abstract class's title is marked italic - that's fine too
abstract MyAbstractClass {
    + qaz : float = 134
}


' class's title is not marked - that's fine as well
class MyClass {
    ' some properties and operations may be merked as abstract

metaclass is not formatted despite it is most abstract thing
in UML
'/
class MyMetaClass <<metaclass>>


/'
when class is marked as some stereotype - whole object gets formatted italic
however, not all stereotype's features should be abstract features, imo,
since stereotype may inject some real functionality into an entity it's applied
onto
'/
class MyStereotype <<stereotype>> {
    + x : int = 8879797
    - qwert() : int
}
